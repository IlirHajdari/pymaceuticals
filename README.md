# Pymaceuticals Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook contains some starter code since the initial folder, which includes the .csv data files,  was pulled down from the course GitLab.

## **Description**
This project involves analyzing data from a preclinical study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc. A pharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer. The primary objective of this analysis was to assess the effectiveness of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, **Capomulin**, in comparison to other treatments.

## **Objective**
As a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, the goal was to generate the necessary tables, figures, and analysis for the technical report of a recent animal study involving **248** mice treated with various drugs.

## **Project Tasks**
The project was broken down into the following tasks:
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Merged mouse metadata with study results inot a single DataFrame.
   - Identified and removed any duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.

2. **Summary Statistics**
	- Calculated key statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM (Standard Error of the Mean) for each drug regimen.

3. **Visualizations**
	- Generated bar charts and pie chars to visualize:
		  - The total number of observations for each drug.
		  - The distribution of male and female mice in the study.

4. **Quartiles, Outliers, and Box Plot Analysis**:
	- Analyzed the final tumor volumes of mice treated with the most promising regemins: **Capomulin, Ramicanse, Infubinol, and Ceftamin**.
	- Calculated quartiles, IQR, and identified potential outliers.
	- Created box plots to visualize the distribution of tumor volumes.

5. **Line Plot and Scatter Plot**:
	- Generated a line plot for a specific mouse treated with Capomulin to track tumor volume over time.
	- Created a scatter plot comparing mouse weight to average tumor volume for the Capomulin regime.

6. **Correlation and REgression Analysis**:
	- Calculated the correlation coefficient between mouse weight and tumor volume for Capomulin.
	- Preformed a linear regression analysis to understand the relationship.
